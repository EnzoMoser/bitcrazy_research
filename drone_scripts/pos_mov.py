This script shows the basic use of the PositionHlCommander class.

Simple example that connects to the crazyflie at `URI` and runs a
sequence. This script requires some kind of location system.

The PositionHlCommander uses position setpoints.

Change the URI variable to your Crazyflie configuration.
