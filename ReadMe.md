# Bitcrazy

This repo includes all the scripts used in this project, but the most important one is [the script that can both map an area and pathfind between two points inside the mapped area](drone_scripts/custom/mapper_drone)

Every folder directory has their own ReadMe.md explaining the files in said folder.

All the Python scripts are inside drone_scripts.
