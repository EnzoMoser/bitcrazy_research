# Bitcrazy Pathfinding Drones
This is the repo used for a research project. The goal of this project was to investigate the viability of using drones from [Bitcraze](https://www.bitcraze.io/) for the module [EEP55C21 Cyber-Physical Systems and Control in Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/media/tcd/elecengineering/pdfs/eep55c21-cyber-physical-systems-and-control.pdf).

This repo includes all the scripts used in this project, but the highlight is [the script that can make a Crazyflie drone both map an area and dynamically pathfind between these two points inside the mapped area](drone_scripts/custom/mapper_drone)
